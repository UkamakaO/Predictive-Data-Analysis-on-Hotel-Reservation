# Predictive-Data-Analysis-on-Hotel-Reservation
### Data Description and Research Question
This dataset describes how online reservation channels have greatly impacted how hotels are booked and led to changes in customer behaviour. Cancelled reservations and no-shows are increasingly common, with reasons such as changes in plans or scheduling conflicts. While guests benefit from the option to cancel for free or at a low cost, this can be a challenge for hotels as it may result in a decrease in revenue.

The hotel reservation dataset of 19 columns and 36,276 rows was retrieved from the Kaggle website in 2022. The original dataset retrieved was randomized by to enable me demonstrate some data cleaning knowledge. Random noise was added by manually deleting some instances and changing some spelling in the data. 
The data dictionary below describes the variables of the dataset.

The research question is to predict the revenue per room (average price per room) made or forfeited by the hotel given other customer reservation details including if there was a cancellation or not. 

**The data preparation for this project was completed in R while the machine learning and deep learning models were built in Python.**
**The data preparation (analysis, evaluation and visualization) aspects were completed collaboratively in R by Ukamaka.O., and Sybil.M.**
